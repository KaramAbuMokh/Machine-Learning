# Machine-Learning
ANN, CNN, RNN, NLP and LSTM. I Built models to predict animals from images, 
predict number in image, predict houses price, predict stocks movements and text auto complete.
With these small projects I learned data analytics techniques like data cleaning, data visualizing, 
data engineering and data augmentation by using libraries like matplotlib, pandans and numpy.
